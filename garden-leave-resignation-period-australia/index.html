<p>2 actrol parts pty ltd v coppi (no 2) [2015] vsc 694. Can an employee be required to take their outstanding annual leave while on garden leave? However, because of the extended timeframe, it can be tricky to negotiate how and when to leave your current position as you embark on a new job search. Continue to be an employee of the company and will make himself available to provide such services directed by the company that are reasonably consistent with executive’s status as a senior executive of the company and; If the employee is on garden leave, the employer may, with certain limitations, reduce the salary paid during the notice period if the employee finds new employment.</p>

Go behind the scenery in Tasmania Australian native</p>
<p>The case concerned an employee who had been placed on gardening leave following his resignation. In response to your resignation letter, which you submitted on [some date], i want to inform you that we accepted your resignation and will release you of your duties on [some date], which will be your last working day.thank you for the early notice. If the resignation comes after an employee�s unfair treatment by the employer, such as harassment or bullying, and it is intended that a claim will be made against the employer at a later. In the absence of express contractual provision, the court will imply a garden leave provision for the duration of a resignation notice period, but not otherwise the employer must maintain all of the employee’s remuneration and entitlements during the notice period to qualify as garden leave. Your employer may place you on garden leave during the notice period to restrain you from communicating information to competitors or using company resources for other employers.</p>
