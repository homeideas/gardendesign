<p>Tried and true, approved by former olive garden chefs. Sweet italian sausage, smoky bacon, tender potatoes and fresh kale all come together in a light, creamy broth. I added turkey sausage to italian sausage and doubled potatoes and broth to make more.</p>
<h3 id="if-you039re-going-for-that-signature-olive-garden-flavor-the-key-is-to-use-spicy-italian-sausage">If you�re going for that signature olive garden flavor, the key is to use <em>spicy</em> italian sausage.</h3><p>I do peel my potatoes, i don�t care for the peelings in my soup. If you like a soup with a beef base, i would have to recommend the pasta e fagioli as it is a hearty soup that is packed full of beans, beef, and so much more, all in every single bite. This was a huge hit at our home and a family favorite one. This is a clone of the olive garden zuppa toscana. It is one of those great recipes i can put on in the slow cooker and run to get add from school or a couple errands and come back to perfection every time.</p>
