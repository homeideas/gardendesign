<p>However, the riddle solver considers that the backyard and the garden is the same place then, then zero people would be left, as the killer would technically.

It doesn’t state that there are 34 people in the room prior to your entry. So let us assume that “i enter the garden” means there is 1 person in the garden and there are 34 people in the backyard.</p>
