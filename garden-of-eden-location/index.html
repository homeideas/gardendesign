Noah�s Ark Garden of eden, Biblical garden, Noahs ark</p>
<p>God’s word makes it clear that the garden of eden was located where there were four rivers coming from one head. The garden of eden is spoken about prominently in the quran and the tafsir (interpretation). The garden of eden’s location may have finally been found thanks to a discovery by an archaeologist in the church of the holy sepulchre in jerusalem, a documentary claimed. It winds through the entire land of havilah, where there is gold…the name of the second. The garden of eden was a center place.</p>
