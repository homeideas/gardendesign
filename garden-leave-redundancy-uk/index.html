But is it a good thing or could it damage your career prospects? In thomas v bnp paribas real estate, the eat allowed an employee�s appeal against a tribunal�s finding that his dismissal was fair, notwithstanding that the tribunal had considered that the redundancy consultation process was insensitive and perfunctory especially as the employee was placed on garden leave at the start of the process. This is known as ‘gardening leave’ and it means that, although you’re not actually working, you’re still legally employed and will receive your normal salary and benefits but: The employee must stay away from work during the whole or part of his notice period but continues to be employed and to receive pay and benefits.</p>

<p>How does garden leave work? We’ll send you a link to a feedback form. Garden (or ‘gardening’) leave is the term typically used to describe an employee who has been dismissed or is at risk of redundancy and is not required in work. Garden leave is basically a device which an employer can use to help protect itself against possible mischief by an employee during his notice period when the employee has resigned or been dismissed. It will take only 2 minutes to fill in.</p>
