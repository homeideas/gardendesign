Chlorosis can have many causes, but is most often associated with an iron or nitrogen deficiency. The black spot fungus, if left untreated, can totally defoliate a rose bush, causing a weakening of the overall rose bush, thus high stress on the plant.</p>

<p>Sporotrichosis is observed with individuals working in tree nurseries, garden centers, working as a gardener in domestic garden and transporting contaminated plant. The fungal infection caused by the sporothrix schenckii fungi is known as sporotrichosis. Although its mechanism is unknown, application of potassium iodide in droplet form can cure cutaneous sporotrichosis. Chlorosis can have many causes, but is most often associated with an iron or nitrogen deficiency. Basically it is a fungal infection caused by sporothrix schenckii that enters the body through minor cuts on the skin while handling vegetation.</p>
