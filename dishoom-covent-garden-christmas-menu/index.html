Once only somewhere you�d find tourists eating out, covent garden�s fortunes as a foodie destination are now such that there�s almost too much choice.

<p>Booking your festivities at maxwell’s will include your very own dedicated party planner, guaranteed to make your event one to remember! The emphasis is on indian street food, with small plates of chilli cheese on toast, spicy calamari, or larger dishes of kebabs, daals or curries on the menu for lunch and dinner. Bookings open for “new” dishoom covent garden soft launch in light of the facts that many of dishoom’s more optimistic guests have already booked for december, and that bookings for the original soft launch dates need to be accommodated, the dishoom team have chosen to extend the soft launch, which will now run from saturday 5th december. Located in the heart of covent garden, the dishes served at frog by adam handling showcase adam’s talent for combining technical savvy with the freshest seasonal produce and exciting flavour pairings. The flagship dishoom in covent garden is still a firm favourite for many loyal fans of the restaurant group despite its expansion across london and beyond by virtue of its unwavering popularity.</p>
