Backpacking South Africa Itinerary &amp; Tips (+Challenges</p>
<p>Nature�s valley nature�s valley is a small village on the garden route along the southern cape coast of south africa, tucked between the soutrivier, the foothills of the tsitsikamma mountains, the indian ocean and the grootrivier lagoon. This year 2019 ,my family decided on the garden route road trip from port elizabeth to cape town. There are many scenic drives in south africa, such as the iconic panorama route in south africa’s mpumalanga province.however, the garden route is one of the most popular and for a good reason. It stretches from mossel bay in the western cape to the storms river which is crossed along the n2 coastal highway over the paul sauer bridge in the extreme western reach of the neighbouring eastern cape. Being so close to cape town, most trips to the garden route will either start or end in this city.</p>

South Africa�s Garden Route Drive from Johannesburg to</p>
<p>To the north, this beautiful park is bounded by the outeniqua mountains, and to the south, it descends to the indian ocean. South africa is such a wild place to visit, and the garden route is one of its best spots. There are many scenic drives in south africa, such as the iconic panorama route in south africa’s mpumalanga province.however, the garden route is one of the most popular and for a good reason. Being so close to cape town, most trips to the garden route will either start or end in this city. The cango caves is one of the worlds great natural wonders, sculptured by nature through the millenia.</p>
