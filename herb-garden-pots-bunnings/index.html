<p>Even if you have miles of property and gardens galore, it�s still convenient to be able to step just out your door and pick a handful of fresh herbs from a beautiful container garden. Do not worry for the beginners; In general, herbs tolerate poor growing conditions and still reward you with aromatic leaves and flowers. My wife enjoys having a small garden of garnishes and herbs close to the kitchen for in fresh summer salads. The three pots in the herb trio kit can be used over and over again whether you use them to house different plants or start more herbs after your initial windowsill plants have become overgrown.</p>
