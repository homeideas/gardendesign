Japanese Tea House and Garden, Descanso Gardens, La Canada</p>
<p>The event is aimed at cars and motorcycles aged 20 years and older, with more modern classics accepted at my discretion. The village is close to the historic market town of dorchester and situated on the river frome. It’s an opportunity meet local professional artists, working in a variety of materials and styles, and maybe discover that unique christmas gift. The event is aimed at cars and motorcycles aged 20 years and older, with more modern classics accepted at my discretion. The event takes place over the weekend of july 27 and 28, with a full programme of poetry and creative workshops.</p>
