Pin by on Health in 2020 Coconut health</p>
<p>For the past 5 years or so, my whole right side has been in pain. One of the most commonly asked questions asked about diatomaceous earth, however, revolves around the safety of using it in the home, as a nutritious supplement, or as a pest control agent. I have to tell you that diatomaceous earth is a ‘miracle’ in my life. While highly effective as an odor blocker, diatomaceous earth is completely ph neutral and chemical free, making it perfect for sensitive skin. It�s supposed to cleanse you of toxins, and strengthen bones, amongst other things, do you think it would be safe to take with tamoxifen?.</p>
