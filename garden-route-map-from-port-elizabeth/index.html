We include a rough guide of how long it should take to drive between the garden route towns, but obviously these garden route driving times can vary depending on traffic and weather. Until you reach storms river (2 hours of driving, 180 km), you are in the eastern cape.</p>

Hotel Sydenham Port elizabeth south africa, Port</p>
<p>The garden route stretches 200 kilometres, from mossel bay in the west to storms river in the east. The garden route is a region on the southern coast of south africa along the n2 national road. At 157,000 people, this is the largest city you’ll come across on the garden route and it’s a great place to stock up on food and gear for the rest of the trip. From cape town we’ll be adding in a wine tour in stellenbocsh, cage. Most international airlines fly into johannesburg and then connect to the other larger cities.</p>
