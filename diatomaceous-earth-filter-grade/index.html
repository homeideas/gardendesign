<p>Something like pool grade diatomaceous earth, used as a natural pool filter, is dangerous to consume or inhale due to its 60% makeup of crystalline silica. Because of the porous nature of the diatom, it has the ability to filter impurities, even in water. Their skeletons are made of a natural substance called silica—which makes up 26% of the earth’s crust by weight.</p>

<p>A diatomaceous earth filter is a filter, usually for swimming pools or drinking water, made of diatomaceous earth. There are two different grades of diatomaceous earth; The high temperatures further harden the diatom exoskeletons, creating a better filtering agent. Something like pool grade diatomaceous earth, used as a natural pool filter, is dangerous to consume or inhale due to its 60% makeup of crystalline silica. This answer to this question is complicated because diatomaceous earth is produced in two forms:</p>

<p>The food grade variety, labeled “generally recognized as safe (gras)” by the u.s. I often see people make claims about the safety of diatomaceous earth that just aren�t true, or are at least incomplete.
