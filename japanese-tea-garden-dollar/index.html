<p>Historic, listed, japanese garden in. 7,069 likes · 640 talking about this · 4,402 were here. The most common japanese tea set material is ceramic. Japanese gardens (日本庭園, nihon teien) are traditional gardens whose designs are accompanied by japanese aesthetics and philosophical ideas, avoid artificial ornamentation, and highlight the natural landscape. The weather stayed dry for my visit although i would say it would be much nicer in the spring and summer months rather than october.</p>
