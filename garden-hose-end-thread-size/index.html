TILTED POT HERB GARDEN! 3/8 inch rebar (4 ft for this</p>
<p>What size is a garden hose? This size is called the ght for garden hose thread, or sometimes the nhr, for national hose. Garden hose adapters and connectors are fittings that have a standard 3/4 garden hose thread (ght) connection on one end and a connection with a different thread type on the other end, such as national pipe taper (npt). The impression what size is a garden hose fitting can induce contrast to the environment. Bushings are used to convert from one size to another.</p>
