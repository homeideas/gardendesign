<p>This is called ‘gardening leave’. In this short guide, we consider what exactly it is, what practical implications it may have for you, and what your rights are if you are placed on it. Gardening leave is a protectionist measure used by an employer when an employee is terminated or when they tender their resignation. If you�re still not sure. A clause to be inserted into an employment contract (for example, standard documents, employment contract for a junior employee or employment contract for a senior employee) or separate agreement giving the employer the right to require the employee to stay at home during the notice period.</p>

<p>Instead, the employee is paid their full salary to stay at home. ‘“garden leave” is a colloquial or euphemistic term for an employer insisting that an employee, who has given notice, stay away from work for the duration of the notice period, whilst continuing to pay the employee’s remuneration’, at [84]; The meaning of garden leave (often known as ‘gardening leave’), is that you require the employee to be away from the workplace during their notice period. Moreover, during garden leave, the employer is under no obligation to provide work or assign any duties to the employee for the whole or part of the employee’s notice period. During this period the employee continues to receive all salary and benefits but is prohibited from commencing employment with new employers until the gardening leave period has expired.</p>

<p>An employee is entitled and obliged to attend work. To enjoy a garden leave provision allowing them to get paid even after leaving a job. Garden leave is typically an arrangement where an employer requires an employee to stay away from work although the employment contract has not been terminated. Important employees are sometimes put on gardening leave so that they cannot give private information about their previous employer to a new employer : It can only be enforced on you once you have resigned with notice or been dismissed with notice.</p>
