Pin on Gardening</p>
<p>2.9 out of 5 stars from 23 genuine reviews on australia�s largest opinion site productreview.com.au. If you’re looking for an organic option that controls weeds, moss, and algae, this popular weed killer might be the product for you. As soon as i sprayed water all the wood chips were laughing at me. Only use all purpose soil. The miniature capsicum plant in bunnings soil looks fine as well.</p>
