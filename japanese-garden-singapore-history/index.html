Singapore, Singapore With a tropical landscape as</p>
<p>Singapore is the largest port in southeast asia and one of the busiest in the world. The idea for a chinese garden came about in 1968 as part of the concept for jurong park, which envisioned the conversion of mangrove swamps on the upper reaches of the jurong river into a green belt with landscaped gardens, a lake and open spaces. See 746 reviews, articles, and 1,276 photos of chinese and japanese gardens, ranked no.51 on tripadvisor among 1,032 attractions in singapore. The most noteworthy landmarks in the garden are its pagodas. The garden�s 5 acres contain sculptures and structures influenced by buddhist and shinto religious beliefs.</p>
