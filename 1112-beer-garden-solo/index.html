<p>1112 shepherd dr, houston, tx 77007. Best beer garden in vienna whilst staying in vienna this summer, we visitied schweizerhaus twice. It was a great finale and we danced and sang the night away with beer and puffed on shisha. Himmel haus is a top restaurant within south lake tahoe for casual dining. 1112 shepherd dr, houston, tx 77007.</p>
