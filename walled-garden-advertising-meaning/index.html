<p>A great example, from history, is the telecommunication industry during its maturing. Programmatic advertising will continue to grow in the coming years, particularly due to continued growth in video and music streaming. A walled garden refers to a limited set of technology or media information provided to users with the intention of creating a monopoly or secure information system. Walled gardens in adtech refer to google, facebook, amazon and apple, which are often written as gafa or faga. Walled garden is a website that is configured to restrict users to specific resources and find it difficult or impossible to access other web resources.</p>
