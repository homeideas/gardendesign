<p><strong>Diatomaceous Earth Filter How It Works</strong>, They are sometimes known in the business as water polishers, since they are capable of filtering particles as small as three microns (in comparison, a grain of salt is about 90 microns in size). Impurities need to be filtered down to the micron to prevent a hazy, unappealing look and taste. It is not as effective, however, at removing color and other dissolved constituents.</p>
